“In this game, the goal is to enter the number 21. You and your opponent will take turns entering
either 1 or 2 which will add to a cumulative total up to 21. You will have 10 seconds to make
your choice or else your choice will automatically be 1. Speed is key to setting high scores.
Each turn, you will score points based off of how fast you enter your response.”
